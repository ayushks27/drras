# 🚨 D-RRAS: Disaster Relief & Resource Allocation System

A C++-based simulation platform for managing real-time disaster relief operations using advanced data structures and algorithms. This project models backend logic for dynamic rescue routing, roadblock-aware navigation, resource optimization, and multilingual alerting — built entirely around core DSA principles.

Built to demonstrate practical application of core DSA knowledge, D-RRAS focuses on real-world backend logic over UI — simulating the kind of intelligent systems used in emergency response centers, logistics management, and large-scale routing platforms. Rather than relying on frameworks, this project reflects **algorithmic problem solving**, **systemic thinking**, and **resource prioritization**.
